I'll create a comprehensive Markdown file that summarizes the project, the changes made, ongoing issues, and TODOs. Based on our conversation and the information provided, I'll structure it to provide a complete overview of the system.

The file should include:
1. Project summary
2. Architecture overview
3. Recent changes (the Meshroom installation fixes)
4. Current issues
5. TODO items for reaching production readiness
6. Quick reference commands

I'll make it professional and detailed enough to serve as documentation for the project.

# E2E Video to 3D Pipeline Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for converting video content into 3D models using photogrammetry techniques. The system leverages a microservices architecture with containerized components for video processing, frame extraction, 3D reconstruction, and data management.

## Architecture Components
- **Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and task scheduling
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and task state storage
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for videos, frames, and 3D models
- **Photogrammetry Service**: Video processing with Meshroom
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed processing of video frames
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA GPU acceleration for 3D reconstruction

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Set up Docker Compose with all required services
- ✅ Configured MinIO for local object storage
- ✅ Created necessary buckets in MinIO (raw-videos, frames, processed-frames, models)
- ✅ Integrated Airflow with PostgreSQL for workflow management
- ✅ Configured Spark master and worker nodes for distributed processing

### Meshroom Integration
- ✅ Successfully installed Meshroom 2021.1.0 in the photogrammetry container
- ✅ Created symbolic links for Meshroom executables:
  - `meshroom_batch -> /opt/meshroom/Meshroom-2021.1.0-av2.4.0-centos7-cuda10.2/meshroom_batch`
  - `meshroom_batch_cpu -> /opt/meshroom/Meshroom-2021.1.0-av2.4.0-centos7-cuda10.2/meshroom_batch`
- ✅ Verified Meshroom is executable from command line

### Airflow Setup
- ✅ Created DAG for photogrammetry pipeline
- ✅ Set up appropriate connections for MinIO integration
- ✅ Configured scheduler and webserver services

### Spark Cluster
- ✅ Verified Spark master and worker are connected
- ✅ Confirmed Spark version 3.4.1 is running correctly

## Current Status

All core components are installed and configured. The system has been verified for:
- ✅ MinIO storage and bucket configuration
- ✅ Meshroom installation and symbolic links
- ✅ Airflow DAG loading
- ✅ Spark cluster connectivity

The pipeline is technically ready for an end-to-end test with a sample video file.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Upload a test video file to the raw-videos bucket in MinIO
- [ ] Unpause the photogrammetry_pipeline DAG in Airflow
- [ ] Monitor the pipeline execution through Airflow UI
- [ ] Verify the generated 3D model in the models bucket

### Near-Term Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling in DAG tasks
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring for all services
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Create a user interface for pipeline monitoring
- [ ] Document API endpoints and interfaces

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add quality metrics for 3D model evaluation
- [ ] Implement more advanced frame selection algorithms
- [ ] Add support for different 3D export formats
- [ ] Scale horizontally for processing multiple videos
- [ ] Add progress tracking and status notifications

## Quick Reference Guide

### Accessing Services
- **Airflow UI**: http://localhost:8080 (airflow/airflow)
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)
- **Spark Master UI**: http://localhost:8001

### Running an End-to-End Test
1. Upload a video file to MinIO:
   - Log in to MinIO Console at http://localhost:9001
   - Navigate to the raw-videos bucket
   - Upload a short (15-30 second) MP4 file

2. Start the Airflow pipeline:
   - Log in to Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080
   - Navigate to DAGs list
   - Find photogrammetry_pipeline
   - Unpause the DAG using the toggle switch

3. Monitor the pipeline:
   - Watch task progress in Airflow UI
   - Check logs with: `docker compose logs -f`

4. View the results:
   - When processing completes, check the models bucket in MinIO
   - The 3D model files should be available for download
