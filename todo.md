I'll create a comprehensive Markdown file that summarizes the project, the changes made, ongoing issues, and TODOs. Based on our conversation and the information provided, I'll structure it to provide a complete overview of the system.

The file should include:
1. Project summary
2. Architecture overview
3. Recent changes (the Meshroom installation fixes)
4. Current issues
5. TODO items for reaching production readiness
6. Quick reference commands

I'll make it professional and detailed enough to serve as documentation for the project.

# E2E Video to 3D Pipeline Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for converting video content into 3D models using photogrammetry techniques. The system leverages a microservices architecture with containerized components for video processing, frame extraction, 3D reconstruction, and data management.

## Architecture Components
- **Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and task scheduling
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and task state storage
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for videos, frames, and 3D models
- **Photogrammetry Service**: Video processing with Meshroom
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed processing of video frames
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA GPU acceleration for 3D reconstruction

## Recent Changes

### Meshroom Integration
- Updated Docker configuration to correctly download and install Meshroom 2021.1.0
- Fixed paths and symbolic links to accommodate the actual directory structure:
  - The extracted directory is `Meshroom-2021.1.0-av2.4.0-centos7-cuda10.2` rather than the expected `Meshroom-2021.1.0-cuda10`
- Created symbolic links to make the Meshroom executable available in the PATH

### Environment Setup
- Added GPU detection and conditional setup in `setup_environment.sh`
- Created basic implementation for `src.main` entry point
- Added MinIO bucket creation for the object storage structure

## Current Issues

### Meshroom Path Mismatch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The Meshroom directory structure doesn't match what was expected in the original Dockerfile
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Symbolic links need to be updated to point to the correct paths
- üîÑ Fixed manually but needs to be updated in Dockerfile for future builds

### Airflow Configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The Airflow service shows deprecation warnings about SQL Alchemy connection configurations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DAGs may not be recognized immediately by the scheduler
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scheduler service may need to be added to docker-compose.yml

### MinIO Setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bucket creation needs verification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Access credentials hardcoded as minioadmin/minioadmin (insecure for production)

## TODO List

### Critical (Before Production)
- [ ] Verify Meshroom executable is correctly linked and functioning:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec photogrammetry meshroom_batch_cpu --help
  ```
- [ ] Update Dockerfile with correct Meshroom paths for future builds
- [ ] Verify MinIO buckets are created and accessible:
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec minio mc ls myminio
  ```
- [ ] Add Airflow scheduler to docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Complete end-to-end test with a sample video

### Important
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management for credentials
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add health checks for all services
- [ ] Add volume persistence for important data
- [ ] Document API endpoints and interfaces
- [ ] Add logging to centralized system

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add quality metrics for 3D model evaluation
- [ ] Implement user interface for pipeline monitoring
- [ ] Add support for different 3D export formats
- [ ] Scale horizontally for processing multiple videos
- [ ] Implement more advanced frame selection algorithms
- [ ] Add progress tracking and status notifications

## Quick Reference Commands

### Container Management
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service_name]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Airflow Management
```bash
# Initialize Airflow database
docker-compose run --rm airflow airflow db init

# Create admin user
docker-compose run --rm airflow airflow users create \
  --username admin \
  --firstname Admin \
  --lastname User \
  --role Admin \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --password admin

# List DAGs
docker-compose exec airflow airflow dags list

# Trigger DAG run
docker-compose exec airflow airflow dags trigger photogrammetry_pipeline
```

### MinIO Management
```bash
# Set MinIO alias
docker-compose exec minio mc alias set myminio http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin

# List buckets
docker-compose exec minio mc ls myminio

# Create buckets
docker-compose exec minio mc mb myminio/raw-videos
docker-compose exec minio mc mb myminio/frames
docker-compose exec minio mc mb myminio/processed-frames
docker-compose exec minio mc mb myminio/models

# Upload test file
docker-compose exec minio mc cp /path/to/video.mp4 myminio/raw-videos/
```
