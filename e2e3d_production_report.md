# E2E3D Production Deployment Report

## Overview
This report documents the deployment attempt of the E2E3D (End-to-End 3D Reconstruction) production environment, including the process, issues encountered, and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Environment
- **Operating System**: Darwin 24.3.0 (macOS)
- **Docker**: Docker Desktop
- **Deployment Command**: `./production/scripts/run_production.sh build`
- **Date**: Current date

## Deployment Process

### Initial Setup
The deployment script performed the following setup steps:
1. Created necessary directories for the production environment
2. Loaded environment variables from a `.env` file
3. Set up configuration files for Grafana, NGINX, and Prometheus
4. Checked for existing Docker images
5. Started the Docker image build process

These initial setup steps completed successfully.

### Docker Image Building
The script successfully built two Docker images:
1. **E2E3D Reconstruction Image** - Based on Python 3.7.9-slim
2. **E2E3D Airflow Image** - Based on Apache Airflow 2.5.3 with Python 3.7

### Docker Compose Services
After building the custom images, the script attempted to start the services defined in the Docker Compose file, including:
- MinIO (object storage)
- NGINX (web server)
- Prometheus (monitoring)
- Redis (caching)
- Grafana (visualization)
- E2E3D Reconstruction Service
- Airflow (workflow orchestration)

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Airflow Permission Error
The Airflow image build initially failed with an error related to user permissions:
```
chown: invalid group: 'airflow:airflow'
```

**Resolution:**
Modified the Dockerfile.airflow to use only the user name without specifying the group:
```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /opt/airflow/data/input /opt/airflow/data/output && \
    chown -R airflow /opt/airflow/data
```

### Issue 2: Entrypoint Script Permission Error
After fixing the first issue, a second permission issue occurred with the entrypoint script:
```
chmod: changing permissions of '/opt/airflow/scripts/airflow-init.sh': Operation not permitted
```

**Resolution:**
Rearranged the Dockerfile.airflow to keep all file operations requiring root privileges together, before switching to the airflow user:
```dockerfile
USER root
RUN mkdir -p /opt/airflow/data/input /opt/airflow/data/output && \
    chown -R airflow /opt/airflow/data

# Create entrypoint script for custom database initialization
COPY production/scripts/airflow-init.sh /opt/airflow/scripts/airflow-init.sh
RUN chmod +x /opt/airflow/scripts/airflow-init.sh

USER airflow
```

### Issue 3: MinIO Client Image Not Found
The deployment process failed when trying to start the Docker Compose services with the following error:
```
Error response from daemon: failed to resolve reference "docker.io/minio/mc:RELEASE.2023-03-20T16-14-27Z": docker.io/minio/mc:RELEASE.2023-03-20T16-14-27Z: not found
```

**Resolution:**
Updated the docker-compose.yml file to use the 'latest' tag for both MinIO Client and MinIO Server:
```yaml
minio:
  image: minio/minio:latest
  # rest of configuration...

minio-setup:
  image: minio/mc:latest
  # rest of configuration...
```

### Issue 4: Container Name Conflict
After updating the image references, the deployment process failed with a container name conflict:
```
Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/e2e3d-minio" is already in use by container "24b244079d3a5efc3cd9b729b03c1f5dc9ee07756e39143501803624d3966afb".
```

**Resolution:**
1. Used the clean operation to remove existing containers and volumes:
   ```bash
   ./production/scripts/run_production.sh clean
   ```
2. Manually removed the persistent MinIO container that wasn't cleaned up:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f e2e3d-minio
   ```
3. Restarted the build process:
   ```bash
   ./production/scripts/run_production.sh build
   ```

### Issue 5: Missing Image Content Digest
Despite successfully building the custom Docker images, the deployment still failed with an error related to a missing content digest:
```
Error response from daemon: NotFound: content digest sha256:7cf513aca411d04e98677eca6ced0a6be67a06e08f8c3b14d8d05bbdc499a614: not found
```

This error indicates that one of the Docker images referenced in the docker-compose.yml file could not be found in the local Docker registry or pulled from Docker Hub. This could be due to:
1. Network connectivity issues when pulling images
2. Docker Hub rate limits or temporary outages
3. Corrupted image references in the local Docker cache

**Potential Resolution:**
1. Pull the required images explicitly before starting the deployment:
   ```bash
   docker pull minio/minio:latest
   docker pull redis:7.0
   docker pull postgres:13
   docker pull prom/prometheus:v2.42.0
   docker pull grafana/grafana:9.4.7
   docker pull nginx:1.23.3-alpine
   ```
2. Check Docker Hub connectivity and rate limits
3. Consider using fixed, known-good image tags instead of 'latest'

## Current Status
The deployment process has successfully resolved multiple configuration and permission issues but is currently blocked by an image content digest not found error. The custom E2E3D Docker images (Reconstruction and Airflow) built successfully, but the deployment cannot complete due to issues with third-party images.

## Progress Summary

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Fixed the permissions issue in the Airflow Dockerfile by correctly ordering the user context switches
- ✅ Successfully built both custom Docker images (E2E3D Reconstruction and Airflow)
- ✅ Updated the MinIO image references to use the 'latest' tag
- ✅ Cleaned up existing containers to prevent name conflicts

### Current Blocking Issue
- ❌ Missing image content digest (likely related to one of the third-party images)

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Image Issues**:
   - Pull required third-party images explicitly
   - Verify Docker Hub connectivity and rate limits
   - Consider using fixed version tags for all images

2. **Monitor the Deployment**:
   - Once image issues are resolved, watch for any further issues during service startup
   - Verify all services come up correctly and are accessible

3. **Validate the Environment**:
   - Once services are running, validate that they are functioning correctly
   - Test the reconstruction workflow through the Airflow DAG
   - Verify monitoring is working in Prometheus and Grafana

## Conclusion

The E2E3D production environment deployment has made significant progress by addressing several configuration and permission issues. However, the deployment is currently facing challenges with Docker image content digests, preventing the environment from fully starting. This highlights common issues encountered in complex Docker-based deployments, including permission management, container naming conflicts, and Docker image availability/caching problems.

To move forward, focus should be placed on resolving the image content digest issue, potentially by explicitly pulling the required images or using more stable image references. Once these issues are resolved, the deployment should establish a fully functional 3D reconstruction pipeline with proper monitoring and orchestration capabilities.
