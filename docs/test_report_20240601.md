## Recommendations

- Add GPU support configuration for improved performance
- Create a more comprehensive test suite with multiple datasets
- Add automated quality metrics for mesh evaluation
- Implement a visualization tool for inspecting reconstruction results
- Consider adding a web interface for easier interaction with the pipeline

## Conclusion

The E2E3D reconstruction pipeline successfully processes image sets into 3D meshes using Docker containers with Python 3.7.9. The system demonstrates good stability and output quality even when running on CPU only. Performance is acceptable for small to medium-sized datasets, though GPU acceleration would be beneficial for larger datasets or production use. The Docker setup provides a consistent environment that should work reliably across different platforms.
